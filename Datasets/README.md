The datasets have been removed due to GitHub space limitations, however they are opensource and free to download at https://ninapro.hevs.ch/.

For this project, DB2 is used for training, & DB3 (amputee sEMG) is used for testing. 
You will need to adjust the code according to your directory location of the databases.
