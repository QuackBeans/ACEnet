This is the metrics and a copy of the augmented model's run.

This run went for 2991 iterations and the best validation accuracy model was taken at 49% accuracy, and therefore is capable of converging at a later point than the unaugmented model.

You can plot the lists by using the analysis.py file and changing the directories. They are the same plots used in the paper.
