This is the metrics and a copy of the model from the first run.

The v1 model is the checkpoint taken from 1650 iterations, where training began to converge.

The metrics go up to iteration 2077, where the training was stopped as the accuracy began to decrease.

You can plot the lists by using the analysis.py file and changing the directories. They are the same plots used in the paper.
